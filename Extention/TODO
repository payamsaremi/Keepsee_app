Needs to be implemented

KIP V0.1


????moved the useState custom hook from newTab to auth, so basicly auth has become
the app's context ,,,, it might need a rename as it does not just providr auth , it also provides state and setState


Try to set the Signout Backup algorithm function from signOut.js to auth.js where you can use supabase onauthchanges to see if user was signed out and then get a backUp there.

3. Add emoji for columns header.
19. Implement a workspace switcher for the sidebar, apps or importtant tasks to lists.
1. make unmanaged tabs column stay to the right without moving .
1. make it possible to create notes inside each column... can work as note, todo, image, task or anything.
1. make a it possile to upload profile pictures
1. when user changes column color but he doesn't click "save" the color doesnt get saved
3. Make it show loading before getting all data (columns).


Not sure about these implementation.

Can you make it so, when user clicks on add new column, the new column get created but get attached to the users's mouse so she can drop it where ever she wants????????
<!-- 2. implement darkmode -->
<!-- 9. backup & remove localStorage when user logsout. -->
